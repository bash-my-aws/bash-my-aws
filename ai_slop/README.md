 # AI Slop Directory

 This directory contains outputs from the `bmai` command which generates bash-my-aws functions on the fly.

 "AI Slop" refers to raw, unfiltered output from AI language models that may need human review before use.
 Simon Willison (creator of the Python LLM package) popularized this usage in the context of CLI tools.

 Each file in this directory represents a generated function, named after the prompt that created it.
 These files serve as a reference and audit trail of AI-generated commands.

 Files are created automatically when you run the `bmai` command to generate missing bash-my-aws
 functions.
