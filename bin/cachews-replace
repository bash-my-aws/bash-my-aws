# cachews-replace - Run a command with awscli replaced by cachews
#
# This allows scripts that call awscli to use caching without modification.
#
# It works by prepending BMA_HOME/bin/replacements to your PATH
#
# For running bash-my-aws commands, a built-in approach is BMA_AWSCLI:
#
#   BMA_AWSCLI=cachews instances
