# 🤖 bmai - Generate BMA commands from natural language

> 🎉 **Experimental Feature Release - January 13, 2025**  
> Released to celebrate Bash-my-AWS's 10th Anniversary! 🎂  
> Using AI to help create the next decade of AWS CLI wizardry ✨

The `bmai` command helps generate bash-my-aws functions from natural language descriptions using AI. It reads the project's conventions and generates compliant functions that follow the established patterns.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Install and configure [llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm)
  ```bash
  pip install llm
  ```
- Configure an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI API key)
  ```bash
  llm keys set openai
  ```

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
source ~/.bash-my-aws/lib/extras/bmai
bmai "list s3 buckets"
```

## ✨ Features

- 🗣️ Generates authentic bash-my-aws functions from natural language descriptions
- 📘 Follows established conventions and patterns
- 🔄 Creates functions that integrate with existing BMA commands
- 💾 Saves generated functions for review

## 🔧 Installation

The `bmai` command is included in the extras directory:

```bash
source ~/.bash-my-aws/lib/extras/bmai
```

## 💡 Examples

```bash
# Generate a command to list S3 buckets
$ bmai "list s3 buckets"
s3-buckets() {
  # List S3 buckets in current region
  #
  #   $ s3-buckets
  #   example-bucket   2019-12-14  NEVER_UPDATED  NO_STACK
  #   another-bucket   2020-03-01  NEVER_UPDATED  NO_STACK

  aws s3api list-buckets \
    --output text \
    --query "
      Buckets[].[
        Name,
        CreationDate,
        join(',', ['NEVER_UPDATED']),
        join(',', ['NO_STACK'])
      ]" |
  columnise
}
```

Generated functions are saved to:
`~/.bash-my-aws/contrib/ai/slop/` 📁

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 📝 Takes a natural language description as input
2. 📖 Reads the project's CONVENTIONS.md file
3. 🧠 Uses AI to generate a compliant function
4. 💾 Saves output to a file for review
5. 📺 Displays the generated function

The generated functions follow BMA conventions including:
- 🎯 Standard argument handling
- 🔄 Integration with skim-stdin
- 📊 Consistent output formatting
- ⚠️ Proper error handling
- 📚 Clear documentation and examples

> 🗒️ Note: The example above shows the author's original response after realizing how simple and elegant the S3 bucket listing function could be while still following all conventions.
