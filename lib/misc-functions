  # Handy function to columnise output
  #
  # Leaving the command itself in functions (for now) to be explicit but
  # I'm finding it handy to have this function at the CLI for formatting
  # output from commands run in a loop.
  #
  # Looped commands (such as those with multiple resources piped in) do
  # not delay output by sending the aggregate through `column`.
