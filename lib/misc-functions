# columnise(): Handy function to columnise output
#
# Leaving the command itself in functions (for now) to be explicit but
# I'm finding it handy to have this function at the CLI for formatting
# output from commands run in a loop.
#
# Looped commands (such as those with multiple resources piped in) do
# not delay output by sending the aggregate through `column`.
