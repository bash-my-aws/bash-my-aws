- instances_in_stack should be a parameter of instances
- rename asg_suspended because it tab completes to the dangerous asg_suspend

- find elb of instance
- find role of instance
- find stack that created a dns record
- get the healthcheck url from an elb.
- grab a file from s3.

cf_delete with multiple stack names.

some things have only accept a single resource.
  inconsistenies in switches. some commands expect a single resource, some
  can take one or more. For example --load-balancer and --load-balancers

some things should return multiple details (like connection draining).
  This makes it difficult to present data as text (ie. line, delimited).

some things always require a value like a r53 resource-record-set needs a zone.
  This breaks the pattern of throw in resources and have it spew out results
  for each. More smarts needs to be included.

You cannot tell what a resource is by looking at it (for instance
CloudFormation stacks). That means that for tools that need to take two
arguements and you cannot identify which is which, you need to use a switch to
tell the app.

how do we want to set a value? --name=value is easiest but '--name value' is a
more common pattern.

setting values require a switch. How do we want to do that?

text output is inconsistent. the results are all on one line.
  aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups             \

    --output ${BMA_OUTPUT}


r53_zones: use list-hosted-zones-by-name and fix the output for prod.
